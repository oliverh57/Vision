# Vision
#### A front end network camera viewer with snapshot support and built in reverse proxy.

Vision is a front end for many common network cameras that enables you to: 
  - Password protect cameras and access them outside of your local network
  - encrypt their stream
  - take snapshots and view them all from the webclient

### New features in 1.1.1
Large Update to the way cameras are handled. The number of cameras can be dynamicly scaled in `\config\config.php`
 
### Installation instructions

* You will need to install a web sever, with PHP installed. (PHP 5 or 7)
* Clone the repository to your web directory using the command ``$ sh git clone https://github.com/oliverh57/Vision.git``.
* Edit the file `\setup\config.php` with information about your cameras and decide on an encryption key and username / password.
* your camera viewer should now be fully operational.

### Side Note
> This software is designed as a front end for cheap network cameras. For full operation with no modification it is advised that you use [MotionEye](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye). This code can easily be adapted however for operation with other cameras; see the guide on adapting this code [here](#)
